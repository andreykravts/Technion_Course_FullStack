<h3>How Web Browsers Parse HTML</h3>

<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>Once the requested web page has been returned, it will be parsed by a web browser then displayed on screen.</p>

<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>The term "parse" refers to the process of breaking apart the HTML document to better "understand" the instructions coded
	there in. During this phase, other resources, like external CSS files or JavaScript files, or images, must be requested
	so that the browser can get a complete picture of the code it is responsible for ultimately rendering. After all those
	external resources are downloaded and analyzed, they are typically loaded into the computer's memory as a tree, or
	hierarchy, of software objects then passed to the rendering engine component of the browser for display (some objects
	"own" or are parents to other objects). A simple example might be that a paragraph is a parent to each sentence, which
	is a parent to each word. There might be other tags and graphical elements that the paragraph owns as well. This is
	simply part of the process of deciding what technique the browser will use to ultimately render the HTML to the screen.</p>

<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>There are many web browsers that are popular today:
	<ul>
		<li>Chrome - the top browser on PCs</li>
			<li>Edge - the default browser in Windows 10</li>
			<li>Internet Explorere - an obsolete browser, as no new features are being developed</li>
			<li>Firefox</li>
			<li>...</li>
	
</ul>

<a href="#pagestructure"><h3 id="PageStructure">HTML5 Web Pages</h3></a>


<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>Each web page should declare which standard it has promised to adhere to. This is called a DOCTYPE , and it is the
	reason that we typed this:</p>

<!-- use special entities for < (&lt;) and for > &gt; otherwise browser will read it as beginning of the doc -->
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 

<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>... at the very top of our web page. This instruction told any web browser that may open it that it should be evaluated
	as an HTML5 document, as opposed to an HTML document of another version. Every instruction should adhere to the HTML5
	specification. If it doesn't, the renderer may not know how to properly apply the rules of HTML5 to the document and
	must drop back into something called "quirks mode" where the browser will take a best guess on how to best render the
	web page. "Quirks mode" exists because there are plenty of poorly coded HTML page in the world and the web browser wants
	to try to the best of its ability to render something to the end user. Since writing HTML that doesn't validate against
	a standard can produce inconsistent results, web developers are strongly encouraged to take great care in the code they
	write. Most tools that allow you to write HTML pages incorporate a validator to ensure the code you write validates
	against your chosen HTML specification.</p>

<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>Once the document has been parsed, the browser can begin the rendering process. "Render" means that the code will be
	translated into visual elements on screen using algorithms and rules coded into the rendering engine, the components in
	the web browser responsible for this activity.</p>

<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>And here is where things start to get messy. Each rendering engine is written by different developers each determining
	how to satisfy the requirements of the specification in their code. Most of the time, your valid HTML5 code will look
	"close enough" on most browser vendor and versions. However, that's unfortunately not always the case and so it is
	important to set your expectations and give you a little heads up on how to deal with the inevitable situation where you
	want to use some new feature that is either supported differently in different browsers or is not supported at all in
	older browsers.</p>

<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>Let's start with the question if there's a standard in place, why do browser vendors implement functionality
	differently? Often this is a matter of interpretation of the specification. The specification details how something
	should work and provides some scenarios. From a technical perspective, there are situations not covered explicitly by
	the specification and vendors need to decide how THEY will handle it. In other cases, different vendors have different
	timeframes on when they plan on supporting the functionality.</p>
