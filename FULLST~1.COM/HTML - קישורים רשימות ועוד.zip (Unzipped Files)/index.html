<h2>Background Every Web Developer Needs to Know</h2>

<a href="#www"><h3 id="wwwreturn">A Brief Overview of the World Wide Web</h3></a>

<!-- the following is p element -->

<p>
	The World Wide Web started out as a means for sharing scientific resources like research documentation
between governmental and academic institutions. It took time for the technologies and
practices to evolve beyond its original purpose.
</p>

<!-- the following is p element, the same is for all the following paragraphs and paragraphs after h headers -->
<p>From a technical perspective, the World Wide Web is comprised of several technologies.</p>

<!-- the following is p element -->
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			First, it involves a simple markup (the Hyper-text Markup Language, or HTML) to both structure and format textual
		information. When first introduced its claim to fame was the hyperlink which allowed the publisher of a document to add
		a link to other research papers available from across the world, creating a virtual web of information.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<!-- the following is p element -->
		<p>Second, one or more interlinked pages are published to a server that is connected to an open network which we know today
			as the Internet.</p>
		</li>
</ol>



<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>
	A protocol was devised that specialized in allowing a request/response-style communication between two computers. In
	other words,
	<b>
		one user requests a document by typing an address for a document into a special program called a web
		browser , and the web browser packages up that request and sends it out into the network.
	</b>  
	The request takes the form of
	a specially formatted packet of data. You can think of this packet of information like a self-addressed stamped envelope
	-- containing both the address of the information requested and the address where that information should be sent back
	to. This specially formatted packet is known as Hyper-text Transfer Protocol , or rather, HTTP , and for simplicity's
	sake you can think of it merely as an electronic envelope.
</p>

<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>The HTTP request message is routed through a series of network wires and routers (i.e., devices that know how to forward
	HTTP messages closer to their destination) spanning the globe using (ideally) the shortest route possible until it
	arrives at its destination, the web server at the address the requestor typed into the web browser. The web server
	responds to the request by locating the requested document or resource (in the figure, the index.html file), packaging
	it up using the same HTTP style envelope, then sending the requested document back on to the network. The connection
	would only take a fraction of a second and once the computer served up the request, it would not retain any information
	about that request in its memory. See next Figure for a diagram of interactivity between the client and server
	computers.</p>

<!-- the following has to be img element. must be located in images folder - make a proper path -->
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/www-diagram.gif" alt = "this is an image of the diagrams" width="1000" height="350"></p>

<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>A diagram of route from the user request to the web server and back again
	Figure. (1) The HTTP Request is (2) routed across the internet to the (3) server which serves the (4) requested file
	back in the body of an HTTP Response message. (5) The HTTP Response is routed across the internet to the original
	requestor. (6) The requested file is parsed and displayed in the user's web browser.</p>

<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>Once the requested document is delivered through the network back to requestor, that document is loaded into the web
	browser. The browser parses through the HTML and decides how to render (or rather, display) its content and appearance
	on the computer screen.</p>


<!-- the following is h3 element -->
<a href="#DomainNames"><h3 id="DomainNamesReturn">What Are Domain Names?</h3></a>


<p>The request that users type into web browsers originally looked something like this: http://157.123.23.44/index.htm
	Why the series of numbers? Each computer on this network was assigned an address, called an Internet Protocol
	Address, or IP Address. This was assigned through a lower-level protocol called Transmission Control Protocol /
	Internet Protocol, or rather, TCP/IP. It was the foundational technology that allowed requests to be routed to the
	appropriate server that contained a given resource, or rather, web page. However, because the IP address for a
	computer would change occasionally for a given computer or institution, they devised a system called the
	<strong>Domain Name System</strong>, or rather, the <strong>DNS</strong>, to turn a friendly name like:
	<br><br>mit.edu ...
	<br><br>into the actual "location", like:
	<br><br>18.72.0.3
</p>

<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>A system of top-level Domain Names was created ... .edu for educational institutions, .mil for Military, .gov for
	Government, .net for Network related resources, .org for Non-profit organizations, .com for Commercial organizations,
	etc. Later, other countries and a plethora of top-level domains were added and others for commercial and other
	interests.
	</p>
<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>The web browser will query databases of domain names and their associated IP Addresses and will translate the requests
	automatically for the user without his or her knowledge. Typically, each Internet Service Provider has a Domain Name
	System server that can be queried for resolving Domain Names into IP Addresses. The databases that contain this Domain
	Name information stay synchronized around the globe, although sometimes the synchronization process can take minutes or
	hours to complete.</p>


<!-- the following is h3 element -->
<a href = "#stdgroups" ><h3 id="stdGroup">The Purpose for Standards Groups</h3></a>

<!-- the following is p element -->
<p>At every step of the way, one or more organizations were formed to help identify standards for these technologies
	comprised of experts and luminaries who were pushing these technologies forward. They would meet both virtually and in
	person to define and discuss the merits of adding new features to a given standard and would encourage organizations who
	were creating hardware and software to follow these standards so that products from different vendors could work
	together seamlessly. Perhaps one of the most influential and important standards body you will hear about is the W3C ,
	or rather, the World Wide Web Consortium . They were one of the groups responsible for the latest version of HTML,
	version 5.</p>
