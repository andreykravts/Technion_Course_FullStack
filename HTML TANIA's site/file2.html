            <h2>Background Every Web Developer Needs to Know</h2>
            <section id="web">
                <h3>A Brief Overview of the World Wide Web</h3>

                <p>The World Wide Web started out as a means for sharing scientific resources like research documentation between governmental and academic institutions. It took time for the technologies and practices to evolve beyond its original purpose.</p>

                <p>From a technical perspective, the World Wide Web is comprised of several technologies: </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>First, it involves a simple markup (the Hyper-text Markup Language, or HTML) to both <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>format</strong> textual information. When first introduced its claim to fame was the hyperlink which allowed the publisher of a document to add a link to other research papers available from across the world, creating a virtual web of information. </li>

                    <li>Second, one or more interlinked pages are published to a server that is connected to an open network which we know today as the Internet.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>A protocol was devised that specialized in allowing a request/response-style communication between two computers. In other words, one user requests a document by typing an address for a document into a special program called a <strong>web browser</strong>, and the web browser packages up that request and sends it out into the network. The request takes the form of a specially formatted packet of data. You can think of this packet of information like a self-addressed stamped envelope -- containing both the address of the information requested and the address where that information should be sent back to. This specially formatted packet is known as <strong>Hyper-text Transfer Protocol</strong>, or rather, <strong>HTTP</strong>, and for simplicity's sake you can think of it merely as an electronic envelope. </p>


                <p>The HTTP request message is routed through a series of network wires and routers (i.e., devices that know how to forward HTTP messages closer to their destination) spanning the globe using (ideally) the shortest route possible until it arrives at its destination, the web server at the address the requestor typed into the web browser. The web server responds to the request by locating the requested document or resource (in the figure, the index.html file), packaging it up using the same HTTP style envelope, then sending the requested document back on to the network. The connection would only take a fraction of a second and once the computer served up the request, it would not retain any information about that request in its memory. See next Figure for a diagram of interactivity between the client and server computers.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/www-diagram.gif">
                    <figcaption>A diagram of route from the user request to the web server and back again Figure. (1) The HTTP Request is (2) routed across the internet to the (3) server which serves the (4) requested file back in the body of an HTTP Response message. (5) The HTTP Response is routed across the internet to the original requestor. (6) The requested file is parsed and displayed in the user's web browser.

                </figure>

                <p>Once the requested document is delivered through the network back to requestor, that document is loaded into the web browser. The browser parses through the HTML and decides how to render (or rather, display) its content and appearance on the computer screen.</p>

            <section id="domains">

                <h3>What Are Domain Names?</h3>

                <p>The request that users type into web browsers originally looked something like this:
                    <br><br>http://157.123.23.44/index.htm
                    <br><br> Why the series of numbers? Each computer on this network was assigned an address, called an Internet Protocol Address, or IP Address. This was assigned through a lower-level protocol called Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol, or rather, TCP/IP. It was the foundational technology that allowed requests to be routed to the appropriate server that contained a given resource, or rather, web page. However, because the IP address for a computer would change occasionally for a given computer or institution, they devised a system called the <strong>Domain Name System</strong>, or rather, the <strong>DNS</strong>, to turn a friendly name like:
                    <br><br>mit.edu ...
                    <br><br>into the actual "location", like:
                    <br><br>18.72.0.3
                </p>

                <p>A system of top-level Domain Names was created ... .edu for educational institutions, .mil for Military, .gov for Government, .net for Network related resources, .org for Non-profit organizations, .com for Commercial organizations, etc. Later, other countries and a plethora of top-level domains were added and others for commercial and other interests.</p>

                <p>The web browser will query databases of domain names and their associated IP Addresses and will translate the requests automatically for the user without his or her knowledge. Typically, each Internet Service Provider has a Domain Name System server that can be queried for resolving Domain Names into IP Addresses. The databases that contain this Domain Name information stay synchronized around the globe, although sometimes the synchronization process can take minutes or hours to complete.</p>

            <section id="groups">
                <h3>The Purpose for Standards Groups</h3>

                <p>At every step of the way, one or more organizations were formed to help identify standards for these technologies comprised of experts and luminaries who were pushing these technologies forward. They would meet both virtually and in person to define and discuss the merits of adding new features to a given standard and would encourage organizations who were creating hardware and software to follow these standards so that products from different vendors could work together seamlessly. Perhaps one of the most influential and important standards body you will hear about is the <strong>W3C</strong>, or rather, the <strong>World Wide Web Consortium</strong>. They were one of the groups responsible for the latest version of HTML, version 5. </p>

            <h2>Web Browsers</h2>
            <section id="browsers">
                <h3>How Web Browsers Parse HTML</h3>


                <p>Once the requested web page has been returned, it will be parsed by a web browser then displayed on screen.</p>

                <p>The term "parse" refers to the process of breaking apart the HTML document to better "understand" the instructions coded there in. During this phase, other resources, like external CSS files or JavaScript files, or images, must be requested so that the browser can get a complete picture of the code it is responsible for ultimately rendering. After all those external resources are downloaded and analyzed, they are typically loaded into the computer's memory as a tree, or hierarchy, of software objects then passed to the rendering engine component of the browser for display (some objects "own" or are parents to other objects). A simple example might be that a paragraph is a parent to each sentence, which is a parent to each word. There might be other tags and graphical elements that the paragraph owns as well. This is simply part of the process of deciding what technique the browser will use to ultimately render the HTML to the screen.</p>

                <p>There are many web browsers that are popular today:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chrome - the top browser on PCs</li>
                    <li>Edge - the default browser in Windows 10</li>
                    <li>Internet Explorer - an obsolete browser, as no new features are being developed</li>
                    <li>Firefox</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul>

            <section id="struc">
                <h3>HTML5 Web Pages</h3>

                <p>Each web page should declare which standard it has promised to adhere to. This is called a
                    <strong>DOCTYPE</strong> and it is the reason that we typed this:
                    <br><br>
                    <br> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                    <br><br>... at the very top of our web page. This instruction told any web browser that may open it that it should be evaluated as an HTML5 document, as opposed to an HTML document of another version. Every instruction should adhere to the HTML5 specification. If it doesn't, the renderer may not know how to properly apply the rules of HTML5 to the document and must drop back into something called "quirks mode" where the browser will take a best guess on how to best render the web page. "Quirks mode" exists because there are plenty of poorly coded HTML page in the world and the web browser wants to try to the best of its ability to render something to the end user. Since writing HTML that doesn't validate against a standard can produce inconsistent results, web developers are strongly encouraged to take great care in the code they write. Most tools that allow you to write HTML pages incorporate a <strong>validator</strong> to ensure the code you write validates against your chosen HTML specification. </p>

                <p>Once the document has been parsed, the browser can begin the rendering process. "Render" means that the code will be translated into visual elements on screen using algorithms and rules coded into the rendering engine, the components in the web browser responsible for this activity. </p>

                <p>And here is where things start to get messy. Each rendering engine is written by different developers each determining how to satisfy the requirements of the specification in their code. Most of the time, your valid HTML5 code will look "close enough" on most browser vendor and versions. However, that's unfortunately not always the case and so it is important to set your expectations and give you a little heads up on how to deal with the inevitable situation where you want to use some new feature that is either supported differently in different browsers or is not supported at all in older browsers.</p>

                <p>Let's start with the question if there's a standard in place, why do browser vendors implement functionality differently? Often this is a matter of interpretation of the specification. The specification details how something should work and provides some scenarios. From a technical perspective, there are situations not covered explicitly by the specification and vendors need to decide how THEY will handle it. In other cases, different vendors have different timeframes on when they plan on supporting the functionality. </p>
